For starters I'm a complete noob to github and am just trying things out. In this folder is a home page of a website that I was copying just for practice to hone my front end skills.  If you want to look at the website that I was trying to recreate here is the url http://www.oystercapital.co.nz/. When recreating it I barely look at their source code and only did so to see the size of certain things. Everything that is left out in my version of the website is because I honestly got stuck and didn't know how to do it. If I suck or can't upload this to guthub please let me know.
